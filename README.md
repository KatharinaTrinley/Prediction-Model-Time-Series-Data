# Processing Time Prediction with TCN + Transformer
This project aims to explore and implement a hybrid TCN and Transformer architecture to improve the accuracy of shipment processing time predictions. By combining the efficient processing and temporal dependency capturing capabilities of TCNs with the powerful self-attention mechanism of Transformers, this hybrid approach offers a robust solution for forecasting in manufacturing contexts.

`preprocessed.txt`: Contains the preprocessed data used for training the model.

`tcn_transformer.py`: Main file that includes the TCN Transformer model.

`lin_reg.py`: Implements a linear regression model.
